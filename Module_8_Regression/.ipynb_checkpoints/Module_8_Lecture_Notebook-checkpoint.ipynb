    "## OLS (bivariate) regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression is a method for assessing a linear relationship between an independent variable $X$ and a dependent (outcome) variable $Y$. Our equation for the regression model looks like this:\n",
    "$${Y_i = \\hat\\alpha + \\hat\\beta X_i + \\hat{u}_i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here ($X_i$,$Y_i$) represent a sample data point. (There are n values of $i$, where n is the sample size.) $\\hat\\alpha$ and $\\hat\\beta$ represent the Y-intercept and the slope of the regression line, respectively. $\\hat{u}_i$ represents a sample residual (or error). We can see this visually by using a modified version of a function we used to understand correlations in model 7. The code below reproduces the figure we saw in the last module but also includes the regression line and a graphical representation of the residual for each point in the dataset. Note that the residual (error), the vertical distance between our data points and the regression line, is bigger for some data points that for others. "

    "Our bivariate regression results are not the end of the story of the effect of happiness on life expectancy. The reason is the likelihood of omitted variable bias. Our sample estimated effect is an unbiased estimate of the population effect only in the unlikely scenario that we have included *all* explanatory variables that affect life expectancy and are corrrelated with happiness. But we know that life expectancy is probably more than just a function of happiness. Wealth probably matters too, and it is correlated with happiness. To generate less biased estimates of the effects of both wealth and happiness on life expectancy we need to include both wealth and happiness in a regression together. That is called multiple regression and the command to do it is a straightforward generalization of the command for bivariate regression. Note in the command below that the variable representing wealth is happiness$gdpcapita, and that it is added to the list of explanatory variables with a `+` sign. "
